# java_web_service_example

USAGE:
    - copy files: Names.txt, ZipCodes.csv in root of C.
    - Deploy web-service for tomcat:
        - If Tomcat is running, stop/kill it.
        - Go to the tomcat installation folder <tomcat>.
        - In <tomcat>, delete the temp and work folders. They only contain temporary files.
        - Copy war file in <tomcat>/deploy or in <tomcat>/webapps folder.
        - Start your tomcat.
    - Point your browser to:
    http://localhost:8080/Lead_Score_Engine
    - input test params in html form and push submit button
    - generated adf-like xml post request will be forwarded to web service
    http://localhost:8080/Lead_Score_Engine/LeadScore
    - it will parse xml-request and create ADF class (all checks will apply in constructor)
    - call method of ADF object to get calculated weight
    - wrap weight for ADF in XML response
    - tested with Tomcat 7.0 & Win7 x64

Side effect:
    Work only in debug mode.
    Generate debug files:
        C://output.xml - sample of xml request generated by engine based on user input
        C://result.xml - returned response in xml format
    During startup it once load and parse Names.txt, ZipCodes.csv
